<p>Part of the DAND project, the EDA project lead the student to analyse
one of the following dataset: * White Wine quality dataset * Red Wine
quality dataset * Financial contribution to Presidential campaing by
states * Loan Data from prosper * Student dataset</p>

<h2 id="further-work">Further work</h2>

<p>Sharing this analysis with wine expert or chemists would be of great
help to further understand the relationship between the data. Ethanol /
Alcohol is for example lighter than water and does impact density, now,
to which extent impact the other variable to the density? Many some
expert knowledge could be used to simplify the models or to put some
theoritical values to compare with.</p>

<p>It would have been intersting to plot the relation between the sulphur
dioxide levels against the age of the wine and the quality rating,
unfortunately this value is missing.</p>

<p>According to the sulphur dioxide levels decrease with Age as it dissipates over time.</p>
